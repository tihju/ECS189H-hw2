Homework 2
This lab is an exercise in fluid layout, celebrating Spring.

You are required to implement Danielle's design, in as fluid and responsive a way as you can. That means:

Avoid giving most elements, especially the page, the header and footer, and the main region, fixed widths; the entire header, for instance, should be visible in any (reasonably large) window, and it should take up the full width, and the graphical elements should be at its left and right ends regardless of the width of the window.
All six vegetable pictures should always appear on the Web page (although maybe you have to scroll down to see them). Avoid making the user scroll right (or change the window width!) to see some of them.
None of the buttons have to do anything!
Implement both the mobile phone design and the laptop/tablet design, and make sure the mobile desgin shows up on phones using the emulator in Chrome developer tools.
On phones, have all the photos in a single column. On a laptop, depending on the width of the window, use a different number of photos per row.
There are some old-fashioned ways of implementing responsive Web pages, that will come up in Web searches, including using float and inline, and libraries like Bootstrap, but you are required to do this implementation using Flexbox.
Stick as close to the design as you can, while making it responsive. It's surprisingly hard!
